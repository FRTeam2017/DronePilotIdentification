# DronePilotIdentification
In order validate the effectiveness of the proposed identification scheme, we conducted experiments in natural and constrained environment. In natural environment, we required 15 pilots utilize P450 and S500 to control drone for the predefined flight mission. We also conducted similar experiments in the constrained environment.
